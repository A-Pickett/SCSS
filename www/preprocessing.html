    <p>We need the scss files to be compiled into css files. To do this we
    run a terminal session with the root folder as our base. Right click on the
  www folder and open new terminal window. </p>

  <p>From there we run the following command:
sass --watch style</p>

<p>We choose style as it is the folder containing our scss files.</p>
